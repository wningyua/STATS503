# Data normalization is very crucial in KNN method.

# Kfold_CV_knn: arguments - k-folds, k_in_KNN, label_in_training

# cv_error: see pic

# natural spline = cubic (k_knots + 4 df(flexible parameters)) +2 restrictors (at the begining and the end should be linear, with difference = 2 at each side )
# 

# smoothing spline: not we specify df rather than lambda
